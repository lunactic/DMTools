Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn.

Hit: 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage.\n\n**Tendril**: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another target.\n\n**Reel**: The roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 ft. straight toward it.\n\n  ",
