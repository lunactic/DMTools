Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.\n\nFirst Roar. Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nSecond Roar.

A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nThird Roar.
