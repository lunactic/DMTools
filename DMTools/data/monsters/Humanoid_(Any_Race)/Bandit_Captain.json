  "name": "Bandit Captain",
  "id": 11944,
  "content": "It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a  silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The  bandit captain has these qualities in spades.\n\nIn addition to managing a crew of selfish  malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the  bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command.  To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out  rewards and punishment on a regular basis.\n\nMore than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate  captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the  captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be treated  fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to  know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.\n\n\n Actions\n\n**Multiattack**: The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.\n\n**Scimitar**: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.\n\n**Dagger**: Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.\n\n Reactions\n\n**Parry**: The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.\n\n  ",
