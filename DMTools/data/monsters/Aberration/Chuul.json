  "content": " Traits\n\n**Amphibious**: The chuul can breathe air and water.\n\n**Sense Magic**: The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the detect magic spell but isn't itself magical.\n\n Actions\n\n**Multiattack**: The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.\n\n**Pincer**: Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures grappled.\n\n**Tentacles**: One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n  ",
