Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.\n\n**Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone.\n\n**Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
