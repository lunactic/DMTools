It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\n\n**Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.\n\n**Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\n\n**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n Legendary Actions\n\nCan take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below.

Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
