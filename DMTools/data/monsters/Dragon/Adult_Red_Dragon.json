It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\n\n**Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.\n\n**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n Legendary Actions\n\nCan take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below.

Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
