Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.\n\n**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\n\n Actions\n\n**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.\n\n**Bite**: Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.\n\n**Claw**: Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.\n\n**Tail**: Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours .\n\n**Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n Legendary Actions\n\nCan take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn.\n\n**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.\n\n**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.\n\n**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
