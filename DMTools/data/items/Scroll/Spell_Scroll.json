If the spell is on your  class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its  spell without providing any material components.  Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the  spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal  casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is  interrupted, the scroll is not lost. \n If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a  higher level than you can normally cast, you must  make an ability check using your spellcasting ability  to determine whether you cast it successfully. The  DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the  spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.  \n The level of the spell on the scroll determines the  spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as  the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.  \n\n\nSpell LevelRaritySave DCAttack BonusCantripCommon13+51stCommon13+52ndUncommon13+53rdUncommon15+74thRare15+75thRare17+96thVery rare17+97thVery rare18+108thVery rare18+109thLegendary19+11 A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as  spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is  copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on  an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10  + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is  successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or  fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.  ",
