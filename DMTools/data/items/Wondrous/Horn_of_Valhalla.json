  "content": "You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.\n\nFour types of horn of ValhallaÂ are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn's type or determines it randomly.\n**d100****Horn Type****Berserkers Summoned****Requirement**01-40Silver2d4 + 2None41-75Brass3d4 + 3Proficiency with all simple weapons76-90Bronze4d4 + 4Proficiency with all medium armor91-00Iron5d4 + 5Proficiency with all martial weaponsIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you.
