  "content": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nPlaying Card — Card:\n\nAce of diamonds — Vizier*\n\nKing of diamonds — Sun\n\nQueen of diamonds — Moon\n\nJack of diamonds — Star\n\nTwo of diamonds — Comet*\n\nAce of hearts — The Fates*\n\nKing of hearts — Throne\n\nQueen of hearts — Key\n\nJack of hearts — Knight\n\nTwo of hearts — Gem*\n\nAce of clubs — Talons*\n\nKing of clubs — The Void\n\nQueen of clubs — Flames\n\nJack of clubs — Skull\n\nTwo of clubs — Idiot*\n\nAce of spades — Donjon*\n\nKing of spades — Ruin\n\nQueen of spades — Euryale\n\nJack of spades — Rogue\n\nTwo of spades — Balance*\n\nJoker (with TM) — Fool*\n\nJoker (without TM) — Jester\n\n* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\n\nBalance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change.

The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nFool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\nGem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\nIdiot: Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1).

The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nKnight: You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you.

You control this character.\n\nMoon: You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\n\nRogue: A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nRuin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nSkull: You summon an avatar of death-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place.
