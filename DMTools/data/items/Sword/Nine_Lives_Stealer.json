If you score a  critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100  hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution  saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears  its life force from its body (a construct or an undead  is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature  is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining,  it loses this property.  ",
